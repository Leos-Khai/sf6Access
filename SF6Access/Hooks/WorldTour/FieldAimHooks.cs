/// <summary>
/// Find people by LOOKING. As the camera turns, every named person it sweeps
/// across is spoken with their distance ("Chun-Li, 12 meters away"), so a
/// player hunting for someone in particular can stand still, turn, and hear
/// who is where — no key, no menu, no census. The nearest person (the shared
/// <see cref="StickyTarget.NearestPerson"/> the homing pulse follows) is marked
/// with a rising tone as well, and "straight ahead" if they have a name,
/// because that is the one the pulse has been pointing at.
///
/// <para><b>Only while the camera is turning (2026-09-07).</b> Walking down a
/// street, people walk INTO the aim cone by themselves, and a sweep that spoke
/// them was a running commentary the player never asked for. A Hero's Call
/// gates its automatic scan the same way — silent while walking straight,
/// spoken on a turn — so the sentence is always an answer to a look. The cone
/// bookkeeping runs regardless, so a look-back after a straight walk finds
/// exactly the people it should.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Quiet by construction, but never stale.</b> A person is spoken when
/// they ENTER the aim cone (half a clock hour) and not again until they have
/// LEFT it by a full hour: wobbling on one person is one sentence, and the
/// only way to hear a name twice is to look away and look back. That second
/// reading is deliberate — "found them, overshot, coming back" must answer
/// (user rule 2026-09-07; a 10 s cooldown was tried first and swallowed
/// exactly that case). One sentence per poll, nearest first. Everyone with a
/// name is spoken, the crowd included: in World Tour a passer-by can be fought
/// or talked to for an item, so unlike the tracker's voice (which follows
/// notable people only, see <see cref="AvatarNameCache"/>) the sweep hides
/// nobody — a look is the player asking. The sweep sentence does not
/// interrupt: it is a background listing, and the reader is free to finish.
/// The nearest person is spoken with an interrupt, and each alignment with
/// them freezes the look input for a beat (<see cref="CameraHoldService"/>).</para>
///
/// <para>Silence rules match the tracker's: nothing during a dialogue, during
/// the panel guide, or while somebody is already in interaction range (the
/// arrival reader owns that moment). Only people within the homing range are
/// swept: beyond it the pulse is silent too, and a name a street away is not
/// something the player can walk to by ear.</para>
