/// <para>Two channels, deliberately unequal. The SPOKEN line is the precise one
/// ("mission at 2 o'clock, 30 meters") but it is rare, because a mission target
/// is a destination you walk to over a minute or two and a reminder every few
/// seconds would be nagging. The SOUND is the continuous one: the mod's own
/// beacon sample, panned toward the objective, dropped an octave when the
/// objective is behind you, and repeated faster the closer you get — so the
/// question "am I still heading the right way" is answered without having to be
/// asked. See <see cref="HomingCue"/> for how those three channels divide up.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The game's own sounds were tried and dropped.</b> The tutorial panel
/// cue lives in a bank tied to the tutorial, so it could only be learned by
/// standing next to one — useless to anyone past that point. The objective's own
/// voice, which replaced it, is a different line every time and was inaudible at
/// 5.5 m while still reporting success, so it SUPPRESSED the fallback and left
/// the player in silence. A beacon has to be one recognisable sound, audible at
/// the range an objective actually sits at; Wwise cannot give that from a bank
/// that is loaded everywhere, and the mod's own mixer can, so the mixer wins.</para>
///
/// <para>No toggle key, like the rest of the World Tour readers, and it stands
/// down for the panel guide: during that tutorial the panels are the objective.</para>
