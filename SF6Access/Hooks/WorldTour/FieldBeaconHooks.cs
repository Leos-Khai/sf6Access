/// <item><b>HOMING</b> — the nearest person, pulsed through the mod's own mixer
///   with the same <see cref="HomingCue"/> the mission beacon uses: panned to
///   the side they are on, an octave down when they are behind, and repeated
///   faster the closer they get. Turning the camera is heard as the pan sliding
///   toward the centre; the aim tone (<see cref="FieldAimHooks"/>) then marks the
///   moment it gets there. The game's own emitter was tried first for this
///   (2026-08-14) and dropped: engine attenuation made it inaudible past a few
///   metres and its 2-7 s beat was far too slow to steer by.</item>
/// <item><b>AMBIENT</b> — a sparse, randomised ping from somebody else, played
///   through THAT NPC's own emitter (<see cref="NpcBeaconService"/>) so it lands
///   in real 3D and reads as the city being alive rather than as the mod beeping
///   over it.</item>

/// directions at once.</para>
