/// One TDB lookup per (concrete type, member) for the whole process. Every hot
/// read goes through here so that a member which does not exist on a type is
/// asked for ONCE and never again.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists — the mechanism.</b> REFrameworkNET's
/// <c>IObject.GetField(name)</c> is not a field read; it is (UnifiedObject.hpp)
/// <c>FindField(name)</c>, and on a miss <c>HandleInvokeMember_Internal("get_" +
/// name)</c>. Both halves log when they miss — <c>"Member not found: X"</c> and
/// <c>"Method not found: get_X"</c> — and the getter half, when it HITS, actually
/// INVOKES the property and boxes the result. So a read written as
/// <c>GetField(name) ?? GetField("&lt;name&gt;k__BackingField") ?? Call("get_" +
/// name)</c> can log three lines and invoke the same getter twice while returning
/// a perfectly good value on the last attempt. Measured on a 89-second World Tour
/// session: 6,966 of the log's 9,398 lines were exactly this, and every discarded
/// box is a finalizable wrapper whose Release runs on the GC thread — the thread
/// the <c>ManagedObject.Internal_Finalize</c> access violation came from.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Keyed on the concrete type's FullName</b>, never on a single
/// process-wide latch: the camera manager, the avatar field state and the flow
/// params all change type between screens and areas, and a latch bound to one
/// type but applied to the next is the stale binding the house rules warn about.
/// TDB metadata itself is static — a member either exists on a type or it never
/// will — so the answer, positive or negative, is good for the process.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What is cached is metadata, never an engine object:</b>
/// <see cref="REFrameworkNET.Field"/> and <see cref="REFrameworkNET.Method"/>
/// handles describe the type, hold no instance and take no reference.</para>
