///
/// <para><c>AvatarBase.GetFieldState()</c> returns an
/// <c>app.worldtour.avatar.AvatarState_FieldBase</c>, which is where World Tour
/// keeps the ray set it uses every frame to decide whether the avatar can step,
/// climb, hang or fall. Each ray is named by the nested <c>CastRayTypes</c> enum,
/// and the state itself owns the geometry (origin, direction, length) for every one
/// of them — so the probe never has to invent a height, a reach or an ordinal. It
/// asks for the segment (<c>GetCastRayPosition</c>), then asks the game to cast it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Which cast, and why only one of the two.</b> The state exposes two:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>bool CastRay(CastRayTypes, out CollisionSystem.HitResult)</c> — its out
///   parameter is a REFERENCE type, so the engine writes a pointer or a whole record
///   THROUGH the address we pass, into memory no caller can shape. It is never
///   called; the dump says so and why. This is the call that killed the game.</item>
/// <item><c>void CastRayAll(CastRayTypes, CastRayResult, eFilterInfo)</c> — its
///   result is an ordinary BY-VALUE object argument the engine mutates in place (the
///   same signature marks its <c>vec3</c> parameters by-ref, so the absence of a
///   marker here is real information). It is the safe call, and it gives strictly
///   more than <c>HitResult</c>: every contact along the ray, each a
///   <c>via.physics.ContactPoint</c> with position, normal, distance and
///   time-of-impact — which is where per-ray hit distance now comes from.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>Nothing here is gated on the collision capsule: this block must produce
/// data even when the capsule is unreadable. Every ray is cast under its own guard,
/// so a type the current state rejects costs one line, not the whole block.</para>
///
/// <para>Diagnostic only, one run per F10 press. Method handles are resolved fresh
/// each run against the LIVE state object's own type chain — the concrete field
/// state changes with what the avatar is doing, and a cached binding from a
/// previous state is exactly the stale handle the house rules warn about.</para>
///
/// <para>Each listed contact also records the collidable's filter (layer id, name
/// and group/subgroup), the contact material's id and attribute bytes, and the
/// GameObject's folder, tag and component type list — enough to tell an
/// interactable (an <c>app.worldtour.om.*</c> component) apart from plain level
/// geometry without a second probe run.</para>
