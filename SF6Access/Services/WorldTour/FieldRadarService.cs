/// <b>The World Tour radar</b> — three beams around the camera, each cast at three
/// body heights, each answering one question: <b>can the player go that way?</b>
///
/// <para>A beam is PASSABLE when the avatar's body can advance far enough along it to
/// be going somewhere (<c>exit.mp3</c>) and BLOCKED when it cannot (<c>impassable.mp3</c>),
/// panned to its side. Nothing sounds while a verdict holds — only a beam that CHANGES
/// verdict speaks. A wall the player is walking into gets a rising tone instead, on
/// every change of the rounded metre; stairs get a rising three-note motif.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it is no longer A Hero's Call's line memory.</b> This started as a
/// faithful port of AHC's <c>ReactiveRadar</c> by way of the RE7 mod
/// (<c>D:\code\re engine\Re7Access\src\RadarService.cs</c>), which remembers the LINE
/// each beam looks at and speaks when that line breaks. Measured in Metro City it fired
/// 109 cues in 90 seconds at 109 DIFFERENT places — not malfunctioning, but correctly
/// reporting that a city facade changes slope about once a second. AHC's world is a
/// tile dungeon where a slope change IS a corner or a door; a street is not. Worse, a
/// line break means "this beam now sees past where the boundary was", which a 40 cm
/// shopfront recess satisfies: the player was told "exit right", turned right, and the
/// spoken readout said blocked. See <see cref="FieldRadarClearance"/> for the full
/// account. What survives from AHC is everything that was never the problem — three
/// beams, the pan, the approach tone, the turn behaviour, the cadence.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Turning is still the scan.</b> There is no movement gate. Turning sweeps
/// the LATERALS across the world, so they keep measuring but stay quiet while the FRONT
/// beam goes on talking — sweeping the camera is how the player aims at an exit
/// (AHC's <c>ResetAllButFrontRadar</c>).</para>
///
/// <para><b>Division of labour.</b> This layer owns the CUES. The spoken class
