/// A repeating homing sound built from one of the mod's OWN audio files: panned

/// faster the closer the target gets.
///
/// <para><b>Why a mod file and not a game sound.</b> Wwise can only fire events
/// that already live in SF6's soundbanks, and the ones that carry far enough to
/// be useful are NPC voice lines — a different line every time, attenuated by the
/// engine's own curves, and inaudible past a few metres. A beacon has to be the
/// SAME recognisable sound every time and has to be audible at the distance a
/// mission objective actually sits at, so it is mixed by the mod instead
/// (<see cref="AudioService"/>).</para>
///
/// <para><b>Three channels, one per question.</b> <i>Pan</i> answers "which way
/// do I turn" and is continuous, straight off the bearing, so a small correction
/// is heard as a small move rather than snapping between three positions.
/// <i>Pitch</i> answers "am I facing it at all": a stereo pan genuinely cannot
/// tell front from back — a target dead ahead and one dead behind both sit in the
/// centre — so the octave drop supplies exactly the bit the pan is missing, and
/// it stays a clean binary so it can never be mistaken for anything else.
/// <i>Cadence</i> answers "am I getting closer", which is the question the player
/// would otherwise have to keep asking out loud.</para>
///
/// <para>The frame is the CAMERA's, from <see cref="FieldDirectionService"/> —
/// World Tour movement is camera-relative, so "ahead" must mean "push the stick
/// up". That maths (including the mirrored-handedness fix) is calibrated in game
/// and lives in that service; nothing here recomputes it.</para>
