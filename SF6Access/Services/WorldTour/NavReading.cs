/// rays report a contact — the height stack is the measurement, so no offset or
/// threshold is invented here.
///
/// <para><b>This is a DESCRIPTION of what lies ahead, not a verdict.</b> The rays of
/// the stack have different reaches (the near rungs about 1.3 m, the long one 2.0 m),
/// so a rung that hits means "there is something of about that height within its own
/// reach", never "you are standing against it". Whether the avatar is actually
/// stopped is <see cref="NavReading.Block"/>, which comes from the game's own
/// collision verdict — see <see cref="FieldNavVerdictService"/>.</para></summary>
