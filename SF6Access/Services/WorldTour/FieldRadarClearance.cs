/// <summary>
/// The radar's DECIDING layer, and the answer to the question the player actually
/// asks: <b>can I go that way?</b>
///
/// <para><b>Why this replaced the line memory.</b> A Hero's Call's radar remembers the
/// LINE of the wall each beam looks at and speaks when that line breaks. It is a
/// faithful model of a tile dungeon, where a slope change in the geometry is a corner
/// or a door and nothing else. A measured session in Metro City logged 109 cues in
/// 90 seconds at 109 DIFFERENT places, with no repetition: the detector was not
/// malfunctioning, it was correctly reporting that a city facade changes slope about
/// once a second — shopfront recesses, columns, awnings, kerbs, benches. The event
/// model has no defence against that, because the event it fires on is real.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And the line break answers the wrong question.</b> Its "open" means "this
/// beam now reaches further past where the boundary was" — a depth discontinuity, not
/// a passage. A doorway recess 40 cm deep produces one. So does the space behind a
/// bench. The player was told "exit to your right", turned right, and the spoken
/// readout — which asks the game's own collision whether the avatar is blocked —
/// said blocked. The two channels disagreed because they were answering two different
/// questions. This layer asks the readout's question.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The measurement.</b> Clearance is how far the avatar's BODY can advance
/// along a beam: three parallel rays at the capsule centre and at ±its radius, taking
/// the most obstructed (<see cref="FieldRayCaster.TryCastBodyStack"/>). A beam that
/// grazes a corner cannot report the street behind it, because the outer ray hits the
/// corner. That is what makes a cue and a walk agree.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The discriminator is enormous.</b> Clearance is measured ALONG the beam,
/// so a side alley reports its own depth — tens of metres — while the open side of an
/// ordinary street reports half the street's width, one to three. The two are not
/// near each other, which is why a wide dead band costs nothing and buys total
/// stability: the avatar must physically travel metres to change a verdict, where the
/// line model flipped on a fraction of a degree of camera settle.</para>
///
/// <para><b>State, not event.</b> Nothing is spoken while a verdict holds. Walking a
/// street with a wall to the left is silent for as long as it stays a wall.</para>
