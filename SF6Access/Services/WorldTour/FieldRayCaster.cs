///
/// <para><b>The filter is the whole point.</b> The existing sweep casts with

/// mask=0x8 [TCStopCamera]</c> — what stops the CAMERA, not the avatar, which is why
/// fences and props the capsule collides with were invisible while kerbs the avatar
/// climbs read as walls. The avatar's real filter is published by the game:
/// <c>CharacterController.FilterInfo</c> (<c>layer=2:Character group=1374 mask=0xA</c>,
/// confirmed in game 2026-09-04), and <c>app.CollisionSystem</c> has a
/// <c>castRayAll</c> overload taking a <c>via.physics.FilterInfo</c> directly. Its
/// group/subgroup being the avatar's should also keep the ray off the avatar; the
/// contact's owning GameObject is compared against the avatar's anyway.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Own segments.</b> Every sideways ray World Tour publishes reaches
/// 0.40–0.60 m (measured) and stretching one only amplifies its grazing-angle noise,
/// so the segment is ours: origin at the avatar's transform (third-person — the
/// avatar, not the camera) at the capsule's own mid-height, direction from the caller.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The CastRayResult is one globalized container for the whole process</b>
/// (<see cref="FieldProbeService.SharedInstance"/>), cleared before every cast. Three
/// other lifetimes were tried in play on 2026-09-09 and ALL THREE killed the game, so
/// this is the record rather than a preference.</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Why any of them died.</b> <c>CreateInstance</c> runs the game's Activator
