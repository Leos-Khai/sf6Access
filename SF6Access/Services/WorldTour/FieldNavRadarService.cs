/// <para><b>Why the game's own rays.</b> <c>AvatarState_FieldBase</c> is where
/// World Tour keeps the ray set it uses every frame to decide whether the avatar
/// can step, climb, hang or fall. Every ray is named (<c>CastRayTypes</c>) and the
/// game owns its height and reach, so the radar never invents an offset: the
/// obstacle class comes from WHICH named rays hit, not from a measured height.
/// Names are resolved against the TDB enum, never by ordinal — a name the game
/// does not publish is simply not cast.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Rays measure, the game judges (2026-09-05).</b> The rays no longer decide
/// whether the avatar is BLOCKED — they only say what is ahead and how far. Deriving
/// "you cannot go forward" from the ladder was wrong in both directions in play: the
/// rungs have different reaches so a real obstruction could fall between them, and
/// <c>TerrainRayFilter</c> does not see fences and props the capsule collides with
/// anyway, while kerbs the avatar climbs by itself read as walls. The verdict now
/// comes from the game's own collision state through
/// <see cref="FieldNavVerdictService"/>; this class is the DISTANCE and DESCRIPTION
/// sensor it is paired with.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The one exception:</b> the SIDEWAYS rays are cast as segments of our own
/// (<see cref="FieldNavSideRays"/>), because every sideways ray the game publishes
/// reaches half a metre or less. Their origin, direction and reach are still read
/// from the game, and they REPLACE the published pair, so the sweep is nine casts
/// either way.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Safety rules carried over from the F10 probe</b> (each learned by
