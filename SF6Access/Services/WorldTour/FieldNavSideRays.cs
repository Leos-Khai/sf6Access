/// The navigation radar's SIDEWAYS sensor — the one ray pair the game does not
/// publish at a range a player can use.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> The radar used to cast the game's own
/// <c>SIDE_R</c> / <c>SIDE_L</c> types, and in play the sides never fired. Measuring
/// every sideways segment the state publishes (from its own
/// <c>GetCastRayPosition</c> output, player at (-2.510, 0.091, -72.181)) says why:
/// <c>SIDE_*</c> reach 0.50 m, <c>BESIDE_*</c> 0.40 m, <c>*_FOWARD</c> 0.60 m — you
/// would have to be all but touching a wall for one to report. That is correct for
/// what the GAME uses them for (wall-hugging and step-around), and useless as
/// echolocation. The engine simply publishes no long sideways ray.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What it does instead.</b> <c>AvatarState_FieldBase</c> also exposes a
/// free-form overload, <c>CastRayAll(ref vec3 start, ref vec3 end, CastRayResult,
/// eFilterInfo)</c>, so the radar can cast a segment of its own. Every number in
/// that segment is still the game's:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Origin</b> — the start point <c>GetCastRayPosition</c> writes for
///   <c>SIDE_R</c>/<c>SIDE_L</c> itself, so the ray leaves from the game's own
///   chest height and never from a Y this code picked.</item>
/// <item><b>Direction</b> — that same published segment, normalized. Reading the
///   direction off the game's own ray is what keeps the sides from being MIRRORED:
///   the dump shows <c>SIDE_R</c> running along <b>−AxisX</b>, not +AxisX, which
///   agrees with the handedness <see cref="FieldDirectionService"/> confirmed in
///   game for the clock readout. Nothing here assumes an axis sign.</item>
/// <item><b>Length</b> — the length of <c>FRONT_LONG</c>, the longest forward probe
///   the state publishes (2.00 m at runtime). The radar's sideways reach is defined
///   AS the game's own longest forward reach, so the sensor is symmetric and no
///   distance is invented. If the game ever changes that ray, the sides follow.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>Cast budget.</b> This does not add casts: the two long rays REPLACE the
/// two short published ones, since any hit inside 0.50 m is also a hit inside the
/// longer segment. It adds three <c>GetCastRayPosition</c> reads per sample (both
/// side segments and the reach), which write into caller-owned buffers and cast
/// nothing.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Safety.</b> The endpoints are <c>ref</c> parameters the engine READS, so
/// they must be populated before the call — the opposite direction of travel from
/// the <c>out</c> buffers elsewhere, but the same rule about the memory: unmanaged,
/// over-reserved and aligned <see cref="FieldOutBuffer"/>, never a managed
/// <c>CreateValueType</c>. Each write is read back through the field metadata before
/// the cast; a mismatch skips the call rather than handing the engine a half-filled
/// struct. The buffers are allocated once and kept for the process — unmanaged memory
/// never moves, so there is nothing to re-acquire, and re-allocating four blocks
/// several times a second would be churn for nothing.</para>
